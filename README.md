# Succubus-Senki-Translation
IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot patch the game with these files. 
The most recent patch can be found whenever the game is updated on Dlsite.

This is the translation script for Succubus Senki. I translate the script and send it to
the creator of the game who patches them into the game!
