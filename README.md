This is an unfinished readme. All will be revealed... when I get around the finishing it.
There's a lot of content I want to cover, so please give it some time ^^
-----------
Dialogue Box and Translation Guide:
- When translating, keep the text limit to *10 words per line OR LESS!* anything over will push out of the textbox.
- When using the heart emojis [❤] follow these conventions:
  - "テクスト❤" -> "Text-❤"
  - "テクスト...❤" -> "Text...❤"
  - "テクスト～❤" -> "Text～❤" (IMPORTANT: Don't do "Text~❤"! The game engine won't recognise this.)
Your branch may not be accpeted if these rules aren't followed!
