This is fan made translation provided by me! Giratena2008.
To patch the game, please move "game.exe" and "data.dts" in this 
folder into the source game folder.

As of now, Ch1~9 has been translated!

If you have any bugs/typos to report, or if you'd like to support the translation,
please let me know on the translation discord server!-> https://discord.gg/rxsQSPZ

You can also view translation progress on github:

If you enjoy the English translation, I hope you'll consider supporting me on
either discord or patreon being a solo translator is tough, so any help
at all is appreciated ^^

With all that said, hope you enjoy the game, and enjoy the translation! ^^ -Giratena2008
